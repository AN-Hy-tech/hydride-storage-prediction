# The hardening board — Phase H

**This is the active board.** [../kanban/](../kanban/) is frozen; see [../docs/FREEZE.md](../docs/FREEZE.md).

This file owns the board's *own logic* — how cards are organised here, how the two boards share one
id space, and where to start. It does not restate what lives elsewhere:

| Looking for | Read |
|---|---|
| Why this phase exists, the leak inventory, the stage order and steps | [../docs/PHASE-H-RUNBOOK.md](../docs/PHASE-H-RUNBOOK.md) |
| What is frozen, why, and the unfreeze condition | [../docs/FREEZE.md](../docs/FREEZE.md) |
| The frozen inverse-design programme | [../docs/PRD-inverse-design.md](../docs/PRD-inverse-design.md), [../kanban/README.md](../kanban/README.md) |
| What a card *is now* | the card itself — it outranks every document above on its own status |
| What a card must prove before it is done | [../docs/QA-PROTOCOL.md](../docs/QA-PROTOCOL.md) |

## Two directories, one id space

Cards live in two directories that are validated together:

| Directory | Ids | State |
|---|---|---|
| `kanban-hardening/` | 1–37, 44, 48, 49, 68, 69–89 | **Active** |
| `../kanban/` | 38–43, 45–47, 50–67 | **Frozen** — every card must stay `backlog` |

**The directories are a freeze boundary, not an id-space boundary.** `blocked_by` reaches across
them, ids are unique across both, and `scripts/check_board.py` loads them as a single graph. Ids were
preserved when cards migrated: renumbering would have broken every `blocked_by` edge, every
`Traces to` link, and the `## Narrative` notes that the ADRs and card #37 are written from.

Three cards were pulled out of the frozen PA phase — **#44** (screen interface), **#48**
(applicability-domain ceiling), **#49** (ElMD novelty). They are not inverse-design work: they are
what lets the interface **refuse** to answer instead of guessing.

**The next free id is #90.** Scan both directories for `max(id) + 1`.

## Layers

Unchanged from the original board — each layer owns one kind of knowledge, and nothing outside it
needs to know that knowledge.

| Layer | Owns | Cards here |
|---|---|---|
| **L0 Foundation** | environment, config, artifact store, gates, CI, **test infrastructure** | 1–7, 68, 69–74, 86 |
| **L1 Data** | source schemas, merge keys, the canonical composition key, split protocol, CleanLab | 9–15, 87 |
| **L2 Descriptors** | element property tables, statistics, the 22-feature contract | 8, 16–22 |
| **L3 Surrogate** | model choice, scaler, quantiles, conformal calibration, the validation protocol | 23–34, 88 |
| **L4 Screens** | the screen verdict, the AD ceiling, novelty | 44, 48, 49 |
| **L6 Delivery** | the prediction contract, the API, the app, the chart vocabulary | 75–84 |
| **L7 Evidence** | glossary, ADRs, the reconciliation, the Chapter 1 revision | 35, 36, 37, 85, 89 |

L5 Search is entirely frozen — it is how *candidates are proposed*, which is inverse design.

## Stage → card map

The runbook executes these in order. S2 and S3 are the only pair that may run in parallel.

| Stage | Cards | Days |
|---|---|---:|
| **S0** Freeze & tooling | 72 | 1 |
| **S1** QA foundation | 69, 70, 5, 71 | 2 |
| **S2** Data layer | 3, 9, 10, 11, 87, 12, 13, 14, 15 | 7 |
| **S3** Descriptor layer | 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 | 6 |
| **S4** Surrogate layer | 23, 24, 25, 88, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 | 13 |
| **S5** Guard rails | 44, 48, 49 | 2.5 |
| **S6** Delivery: contract + API | 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80 | 5 |
| **S7** Delivery: interface | 81, 82, 83, 84 | 3.5 |
| **S8** Evidence & close | 89, 85, 86, 35, 36, 37 | 5 |

Cards **4, 6, 7, 73, 74** are foundation and CI work that slots in where its blockers allow rather
than sitting in one stage. **#5** (the gate harness) was the same kind of card and has landed inside
S1, where it belonged: every gate card on the board was blocked behind it.

## Gates

Nine are live in this phase — four new, five inherited from the PRD's acceptance criteria. The full
table with failure conditions is in [../docs/PHASE-H-RUNBOOK.md](../docs/PHASE-H-RUNBOOK.md) §4.

All of them are registered in the gate harness (#5), together with the three frozen criteria, so the
registry is the complete list of what the project has promised to check rather than the subset it can
currently check. Ask it rather than this table: `python -m hydms.gates list`.

| Gate | Card | | Gate | Card |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **HG-1** leak sentinels | 71 | | AC-1 seed reproducibility | 32 |
| **HG-2** no bare numbers | 77 | | AC-2 featuriser parity | 21 |
| **HG-3** transport parity | 79 | | AC-3 conformal coverage | 31 |
| **HG-4** hygiene | 86 | | AC-4 known-alloy round-trip | 33 |
| | | | AC-6 leave-one-class-out | 30 |

AC-5 is thermodynamic and AC-7/AC-8 are inverse-design; all three stay frozen with their cards.

**Two hard gates block everything behind them.** #21 (featuriser parity) gates every card downstream
of selection — if the reimplementation does not reproduce CBFV to 1e-9, the reimplementation is
wrong, not CBFV. And #71 (leak sentinels) is what makes the phase durable: without it, nothing stops
the next session reintroducing a leak the phase just removed.

## Start here

Ask the board rather than trusting a list — a list here goes stale the moment a card moves.

```bash
S=../.claude/skills/kanban-ai/scripts
bash $S/show_blocked.sh .          # what is waiting on what
bash $S/view_board.sh .            # everything by status
bash $S/list_all_cards.sh .        # id | status | blocked_by | title
```

### Handoff — 2026-09-02 (evening)

**S1 is one card from closed.** The gate harness (**#5**) has landed, which was the only thing
standing between the board and **#71**, the leak sentinels. Nine cards are done — #1, #2, #8, #68,
#72, #69, #70, #3 and now #5 — with **69 tests green**, ruff and mypy clean, and both halves of the
freeze still enforced.

**Take #71 next.** It closes S1 and it is what makes the phase durable: it is the difference between
removing thirteen leaks and *keeping* them removed. The harness registers it as `HG-1` already, so
the work is writing `tests/leaks/` and replacing one `Pending` with a real check. Read
[../docs/PHASE-H-RUNBOOK.md](../docs/PHASE-H-RUNBOOK.md) §1 first — the thirteen leaks with their
exact line numbers are the definition of done for S2 to S4, and the two that are not in the PRD,
`CleanLab.py:90` rewriting held-out labels and the positional concat in `merge_datasets.py:46`, are
the severe ones. Each sentinel must be **seen red** with its leak deliberately put back, and that
demonstration recorded in the card's `## Narrative`; a sentinel nobody has watched fail is an
assumption with a test's name on it.

**Running alongside:** #4, #9, #16, #19 and #44 are unblocked. #9 → #10 → #87 is the S2 chain leading
to the canonical composition key; #16 opens the S3 descriptor work in parallel. #6 is unblocked too
now that #5 has landed.

**What #5 changed for everyone else.** `python -m hydms.gates list` is now the authoritative list of
what this project has promised to check — twelve criteria, all `SKIPPED`, each naming the card that
owes it. Two behaviours are worth knowing before you write a gate: naming one (`run AC-2`) exits
non-zero while it is unimplemented, so a gate card's runnable check is honest from the day it is
written, while `run --all` tolerates skips and prints a `NOT CHECKED` banner instead. And every gate
declares its own CI lane, so cards #6 and #7 read the split rather than deciding it.

**Two corrections were owed and are now made.** Card **#6** assumed lint and type checks run inside
the `Project` conda environment; they were deliberately left outside it, so #6 is now two
independently-reporting jobs — a conda-free `hygiene` job and a `suite` job that pays for the
environment — and its runnable check is the lane's own commands rather than `gh run watch`, which
could not fail before the workflow existed. **#86** carries the same note so it cannot inherit the
assumption. The runbook's §5 verification block had the same mistake and is fixed there too.

**One new gap, for #86.** Neither `pytest-cov` nor `coverage` is installed in `Project`, so
`pytest --cov` fails outright and the coverage floor in `pyproject.toml` is unenforceable
*anywhere* today. Both are declared in the `dev` extra and nothing installed them. Adding a package
to `Project` invalidates `environment.lock.yml`, so where they get installed is a decision, not a
`pip install`.

---

## Using the board

Unchanged from the original board's rules:

- Move a card by editing its `status`: `backlog` → `todo` → `doing` → `done`.
- **Before moving a card to `doing`, every id in its `blocked_by` must be `done`.** CI enforces this.
- Append to `## Narrative` when a card teaches you something, ISO-dated, `(by @...)`. Those notes are
  the record of *why*, and they are what the ADRs (#36) and the Chapter 1 revision (#37) are written
  from.
- New cards carry: `id`, `status`, `priority`, `blocked_by`, `assignee`, `tags`; an
  `> **Owns (hidden behind this module):**` blockquote; `## Why this exists`; `## Done when`;
  a single-command `## Runnable check`; `## Traces to`; and `## Narrative`.
- Tags lead with the phase, then the layer, then traces: `ph, l3, HG-1, AC-6`.

`scripts/check_board.py` will reject a dangling `blocked_by`, a dependency cycle, an id that does not
match its filename prefix, an illegal status, a card on the frozen board that has left `backlog`, and
any relative Markdown link that does not resolve.

## A note on the `ml-model-training` skill

Installed for this phase and useful for model-fitting mechanics. It is **silent** on group-aware
splitting, nested cross-validation, and early stopping on the scoring set, and its worked example is a
plain `train_test_split` with no `random_state` and no grouping — which in this project would
reintroduce leaks L4, L7 and L8. This project's authority order puts skills below the
[../research/](../research/) memos; on any validation question the memos and the runbook win.
